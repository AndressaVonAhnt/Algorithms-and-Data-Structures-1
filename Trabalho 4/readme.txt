Andressa Von Ahnt - M1

Overview

This program implements a solution to maximize the profit earned by assigning workers to jobs based on their skill level. The solution is implemented using QuickSort for sorting the difficulty and profit arrays, and a greedy approach for job allocation. The program follows the Doom Engine Coding Style Guide.


Features

Sorts jobs based on profit using QuickSort.

Assigns workers to the highest-paying job they can handle.

Uses an efficient approach to maximize total profit.



Functions

Partition

int Partition( int arrDifficulty[], int arrProfit[], int low, int high )

Partitions the difficulty and profit arrays for QuickSort.

Sorts the array based on descending order of profit.


QuickSort

void QuickSort( int arrDifficulty[], int arrProfit[], int low, int high )

Implements QuickSort algorithm to sort jobs based on profit.


CheckDifficulty

int CheckDifficulty( const int *difficulty, int size, int index )

Finds the highest difficulty level a worker can handle.


MaxProfitAssignment

int MaxProfitAssignment( int *difficulty, int difficultySize, int *profit, int profitSize, int *worker, int workerSize )

Assigns workers to jobs and calculates the maximum total profit.


main

int main( void )

Defines job difficulties, profits, and worker skill levels.

Calls MaxProfitAssignment and prints the maximum profit.
